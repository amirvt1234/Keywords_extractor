# Keywords extractor

To find the key phrases that present in any given HTML page. My idea was to implement the method
described in [Rose et al.(2010)Rose, Engel, Cramer, and Cowley] with some additional features as
following:

- The web-page creator might have already provided some keywords. We can use them in our
pool.
- We can emphasize more on the words that appear on the title.
